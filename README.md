# CSY1020-Assignment-2

<h2>Aim</h2>
<p>Using the Green Scenario included, produce a technical report and accompanying Java GUI application, simulating control of the ball moving (navigated) around the maze using left, right, up and down buttons/keys.</p>
<p>The problem is designed to be open within the rules below, to enable you to develop your solution(s) to the problem.<p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Rules (Basic) Create a simulation of the ball moving around the pitch, where:<p>
  <ul>
    <li>The ball must only travel when on the ‘sand’-coloured blocks otherwise it should not move.</li>
    <li>The ball must move one whole ‘sand’-coloured blocks at a time every time a movement key is pressed - via a direction button (<, > v ^)) - (when movement is possible). </li>
    <li>Must use the scenario provided.</li>
    <li>Must stop when it the ball reaches the grey block at the end of the maze.</li>
    <li>The basic solution must be completed using the ‘act’ button (accessing the moveBall() method within the CBallMaze.class).</li>
</ul>

<p>Rules (Intermediate and advanced) Create a simulation of a ball moving around the maze, where:</p>
<p>Rules (Intermediate)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Whilst maintaining the features of the basic solution add the following</li>
  <li>When there is a block below the block the ball is automatically go down. In other words if the ball can drop it ‘falls’ down until a white space is below it.</li>
  <li>Add a sound effect when the ball drops.</li>
  <li>The ball must not fall into the white spaces.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rules (Advanced)<p>
  <ul>
    <li>For higher grades on the solution part of the assignment see the marking scheme/rubric. You must NOT change the layout and all changes should still meet the criteria of Rules (Basic).</li>
</ul>
